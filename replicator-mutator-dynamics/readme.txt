###Readme file for 'replicator-mutator-dynamics'

This folder contains code to generate predictions about population level transmission and use of linguistic types (combinations of lexica and linguistic behavior). A pressure for communicative efficiency is exherted by the replicator dynamics, and a pressure for learnability by the mutator dynamics (corresponding to iterated Bayesian learning).

The code allows for variable specification of linguistic behavior (soft-maximization, best response, depth of mutual reasoning, ...), the kind of dynamics considered (replication only, mutation only, or replication and mutation), learning behavior (soft-maximization, posterior sampling/maximization), and data sparsity (sequence length, number of samples per parent type).

Details about the model's inner workings and theoretical background are found in:
