###Readme file for 'adaptation'

This folder contains code to generate predictions about adaptation in dyadic iterated interactions and ambiguous language use. Players adapt their subjective contextual expectations to the context in which they interaction, and senders adjust their beliefs about their interlocutors' contextual expectations through inference about what can be learned from overt linguistic behavior.

Details about the model's inner workings and theoretical background are found in:
